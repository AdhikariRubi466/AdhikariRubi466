## 🌸 About Me

I am a **Computer Engineering student** who enjoys building systems that connect **software, data, and hardware**.  
Rather than focusing only on theory, I prefer learning through **hands-on projects** that reflect real-world use cases.

I believe good engineering starts with **clear problem understanding**, followed by simple design and clean implementation.
