## 🧭 About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in **software development, data analytics, and logical problem-solving**.  
I enjoy working on projects that help me understand how systems behave in real-world scenarios rather than focusing only on theoretical outcomes.

My approach is simple: understand the problem deeply, design a clear solution, and then implement it with clean and maintainable code.
